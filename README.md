# AI / ML Portfolio 🚀

This repository contains **end-to-end, production-style projects** demonstrating my practical skills across:

- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- MLOps
- Generative AI (RAG systems)
- Model deployment with FastAPI & Docker

Each project is designed to reflect **real-world industry workflows**, not just academic experiments.

🎯 Goal of This Portfolio

To demonstrate the ability to:

Build models end-to-end

Deploy them reliably

Reason about design decisions

Write clean, maintainable code

📌 All large datasets, model weights, and generated artifacts are intentionally excluded from version control.
